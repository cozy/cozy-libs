# What's cozy-release?

`cozy-release` is a tool that helps you to create new releases and beta of your library.
Once `cozy-release` successfully created a tag for your release, all you need to do is to go on github and publish it.

## Setup

### Install

Dependencies:

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

`npm install --save cozy-release`
or
`yarn add cozy-release`

## How to use it

Existing commands and options are detailed in the help:

```
cozy-release --help
```

**Warning:** Note that `cozy-release` uses `x.y.z` format. If your app previously used `vx.y.z` format, you will need to manually create a tag that matches the right format:

```
git checkout vx.y.z
git tag -a x.y.z
```

**Warning:** When you create a patch using `cozy-release patch 1.0.0`, It will create the patch branch from the version you have given. It may be inconvenient if you try to create a release for an app that is still in beta. In this case, you will need to rebase master afterwards.
