# Cozy-Harvest-Lib

# Goal

Cozy-Harvest-Lib is responsible for the logic and components used in harvest applications.

Harvest applications will be apps which will allow to configure konnectors, setup authentification informations and check for synchronized data (And much more in the future).
Each harvest application will be associated with only one konnector.

# Current version

The current version exposes base components to create and edit account and trigger documents.

Those components are used for now in [Cozy-Home](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-home).

# Installation

Just run

```
yarn add cozy-harvest-lib
```

# Importing

Components imported from cozy-harvest-lib **must** be imported from the root of the package, and not from specific files:

```
// imported from the root of the package üëç
import { TriggerManager } from 'cozy-harvest-lib'

// imported from another file or folder üëé
import TriggerManager from 'cozy-harvest-lib/TriggerManager'
```

This is because all harvest components come with their own translation context. If you really do need to import a component straight from the shipped file, there is a `withLocales` HOC that is available, so something like this would work as a fallback:

```
import TriggerManager from 'cozy-harvest-lib/TriggerManager'
import { withLocales } from 'cozy-harvest-lib'

const MyTriggerManager = withLocales(TriggerManager)
```

# Getting Started

For now it is possible to instanciate a `<TriggerManager />` which will allow to edit an account and launch the trigger.

As this component uses CozyClient, it must be wrapped at some point into a [`<CozyProvider />`](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#wrapping-the-app-in-a-cozyprovider).

```js
import CozyClient, { CozyProvider } from 'cozy-client'
import { TriggerManager } from 'cozy-harvest-lib'

const client = new CozyClient({
  /*...*/
})

ReactDOM.render(
  <CozyProvider client={client}>
    <Query query={client => client.get('io.cozy.apps', 'my-konnector-id')}>
      {konnector => (
        <TriggerManager
          konnector={konnector}
          onSuccessLogin={() => alert('logged in')}
        />
      )}
    </Query>
    // other stuff
  </CozyProvider>,
  document.getElementById('main')
)
```
